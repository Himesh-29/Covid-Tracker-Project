### NOTE: Try to resize the image in carousel, as one of the images, which is a slight bigger than the rest, causes the form to shift down...

### From Himesh side:

#### 1) Resized the images so that they fit in carousel

#### 2) Added the core functionality of fetching data from API and displaying it on table

### Issues from Himesh side:

#### 1) Only 4 states are present inside the search query, add the remaining states

#### 2) Some designing issues (responsibility according to device size, and very low level designing done)

### Suggestion from my side: Insteading of displaying 29 states, shall we create a table on the main home page which will show the cases for each state, rather than user searching a particular states?
